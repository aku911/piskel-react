This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Piskel-App clone
This is my attempt at learning how to do react by copying an existing website [http://www.piskelapp.com]

# Building
Mostly I run from within VS Code using the Chrome Debug extension and just iterate that way, but this should get you building too:
- Install node.js
- Run 'npm install' from the root source directory
- Run 'npm run build'
